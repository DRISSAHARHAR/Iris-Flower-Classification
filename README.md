# Iris-Flower-Classification
This GitHub repository hosts the Iris Flower Classification project, a comprehensive machine learning task aimed at developing a model to accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements.The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model development using popular classification algorithms, evaluation metrics, and visualization. This repository serves as an excellent resource for those seeking an introduction to classification tasks and practical machine learning implementation using the widely-used Iris dataset.
